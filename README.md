# gepy: Genetic Expression Programming in Python
This is a simple library that implements Genetic Expression Programming (see the book from Ferreira, 2005).
It is Python3 only and is thought to replace the old PyGEP, supporting a similar syntax.

## Rationale of the chromosomes
The chromosome parameters are:
- `head_length`: How long are the heads of the genes
- `gene_number`: How many genes there should be
- `functions`: Which functions are used to generate the tree
- `terminals`: Which terminals are used in the tree
- `random_dc`: If to add random domain and autogenerated constants
- `random_num`: How many random constants to have per gene
- `adf_length`: How long are the heads of the adf section
- `adf_functions`: Which functions to use in the adf section
- `adf_num`: How many adf to have per chromosome
- `link_function`: Which function to use for linking
